    <h1><center>MARKETING DESIGNING:</center></h1>
    <p>Marketing design applies graphic design principles to the ultimate goals of a marketing effort. It encompasses both the creation of a recognizable visual identity that will appeal to potential customers and the marketing team’s deployment of that identity in the form of internally consistent assets.

Marketing design is an essential piece of a business’s marketing strategy since good design is one of the primary ways to grab your target audience’s attention. The marketing graphics that a design team creates are also vital to a positive user experience since welcoming visuals will make customers more likely to return.
</p><h2> A QUICK HISTORY OF MARKETING:</h2>

However, marketing can be tied back to the printing press and the first magazines. From there came other types of print advertising, including billboards. However, marketing has evolved along with technology.
